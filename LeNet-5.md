# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Processing

This describes a common architecture pattern in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for processing image data, exemplified by models like LeNet-5. The process involves iteratively extracting features and reducing dimensionality before classifying the image.

## Core Steps

1.  **Input Image:**
    * The process begins with an input image, represented as a multi-dimensional array of pixel values (e.g., height x width x color channels).

2.  **Convolutional Layers:**
    * **Feature Extraction:** One or more convolutional layers are applied to the input image. Each convolutional layer utilizes a set of learnable **filters** (also known as kernels).
    * **Feature Maps:** These filters convolve across the input image, performing element-wise multiplications and summations to detect specific spatial hierarchies of features (e.g., edges, corners, textures). The output of each filter applied to the input is a **feature map**, highlighting the presence and location of the learned feature.

3.  **Pooling Layers:**
    * **Downsampling:** Following the convolutional layers, pooling layers (often **Max-Pooling**) are typically used to reduce the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the feature maps.
    * **Translation Invariance:** Max-pooling selects the maximum value within a defined window of the feature map. This provides a degree of translation invariance, making the model more robust to small shifts in the position of features within the image. It also reduces the number of parameters, mitigating overfitting.

4.  **Iterative Feature Extraction and Reduction:**
    * The combination of convolutional layers (for feature extraction) and pooling layers (for dimensionality reduction) is often repeated multiple times.
    * **Hierarchical Feature Learning:** As the data propagates through these stacked layers, the network learns increasingly complex and abstract features. Earlier layers might detect basic features like edges, while deeper layers can learn higher-level concepts by combining these simpler features.

5.  **Flatten Layer:**
    * **Vectorization:** Before connecting to fully connected (dense) layers for classification or regression, the multi-dimensional output of the final pooling layer needs to be flattened into a one-dimensional vector. This **flatten layer** simply concatenates all the values from the feature maps into a single long vector.

6.  **Dense (Fully Connected) Layers:**
    * **Classification/Regression:** The flattened vector is then fed into one or more fully connected (dense) layers. In these layers, each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.
    * **Decision Making:** These layers learn complex relationships between the extracted features and perform the final task, such as image classification (assigning a label to the image) or regression (predicting a continuous value).

7.  **Output Layer:**
    * The final dense layer typically has an output size corresponding to the number of classes in a classification task or a single output for regression. An appropriate activation function (e.g., Softmax for multi-class classification, Sigmoid for binary classification, or linear for regression) is applied to produce the final predictions.

This process, involving convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction, pooling layers for downsampling and increased robustness, and fully connected layers for final decision making, forms the foundation of many successful CNN architectures used in computer vision.
